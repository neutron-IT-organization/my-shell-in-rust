# Neutron Shell in Rust

Welcome to Neutron Shell, a simple shell implementation in Rust!

This shell allows you to execute commands and navigate through your system effortlessly.

## Usage

To use Neutron Shell, simply compile the code and run the executable. You will be greeted with a prompt where you can enter commands. Neutron Shell supports basic commands like `cd` and `exit`, as well as executing other programs.

## How to Compile and Run

To compile the code, make sure you have Rust installed on your system. Then, navigate to the directory containing the `main.rs` file and run the following command:

```
cargo build --release
```

This will generate an executable file in the `target/release` directory. You can run the executable by executing the following command:

```
./target/release/neutron-shell
```
